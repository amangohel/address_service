# If I had more time on this tech test I would have added some test coverage for authentication views
# Testing the following

# - that a user can login with a valid token
# - that a token expires after a day and that a new one is assigned when the old one expires
# - that a user can logout and that the token is deleted
# - that a user can't login with an invalid token
# - that a user can't login with an expired token
# - that a user can't login with a token that doesn't exist
# - that a user can't login with a token that doesn't belong to them
# - that a user can't login with a token that has been deleted

# this test file would also live within tests/ under authentication/ (following the pattern for the addressbook API)
